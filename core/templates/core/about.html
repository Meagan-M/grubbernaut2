        <section>
            <p class="our-project">This project was developed out of a desire to make public information that is not easily accessible available in a user-friendly format. To create the Grubbernaut app, data from four API's-- three from Wake County Health Inspections as well as Yelp Fusion-- were used. The app was built using Django, JavaScript, HTML and CSS. Graphic elements were developed using Charts.js. The Grubbernaut app's clean, simple design makes comparing health inspection scores and Yelp ratings quick and easy for the user.</p>
